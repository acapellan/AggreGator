## Product Backlog

Product backlog items have been numbered and listed in priority. Additional knowledge acquisition
items were added to the top of the backlog in preparation for the first sprint. These items are
additionally broken down into assignable tasks in the first sprint backlog located further down in

## Planning Poker

Each team member independently assigned points to each PBI based on their thoughts on the amount of
time and effort it would require to complete. Members came up with their own numbers before sharing
their thoughts with the group in an effort to avoid groupthink. Each member's initial score is located
in the associated column labeled with their initials. The final and agreed upon score is indicated in
the last column. Items with disparate scores were resolved through team discussion. A summary of these
discussions is listed further below. Relative story points were assigned a value from the following
fibonacci-like sequence:

> 0, Â½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 50, 100, and ?

### Discussion

## Sprint Backlog #1

For the first sprint, items 1 through `\* TODO: how many items for the first sprint? *\` were selected
from the product backlog. Each of these items were additionally groomed to adhere to DEEP principles.
The table below summarizes the individual tasks that the team believes needs to be completed in order
to meet the first sprint objectives.

`\* TODO: breakdown items further, estimate time, and assign to team member *\`
