## Product Backlog

Product backlog items (PBIs) were created from user stories and assigned a number for identification.
Additional knowledge acquisition PBIs were added to the backlog in preparation for the first sprint.
Priority has not yet been assigned, and will be done so after the team completes a round of planning
poker.

## Planning Poker

Each team member independently assigned points to each PBI based on their thoughts on the amount of
time and effort it would require to complete. Members came up with their own numbers before sharing
their thoughts with the group in an effort to avoid groupthink. Each member's initial score is located
in the associated column labeled with their initials.

The final and agreed upon score is indicated in the final estimation column. Items with disparate scores
were resolved through team discussion. A summary of some of these discussions is listed under the table.
Relative story points were assigned a value from the following fibonacci-like sequence:

> 0, Â½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 50, 100, and ?

### Discussion

At the conclusion of planning poker, the product backlog was sorted from smallest final estimation to
largest. The one exception was PBI #2. The team decided this knowledge acquisition item needed to be
near the top to ensure it was included in the first sprint.

In addition, every team member also came up with a different estimation for PBI #2. During the discussion,
it was discovered that one team member had the most experience with databases, and they were able explain
how the item would be more complex than expected. The team agreed and went with his recommendation.

For the items that had a range of estimates, the product owner listened to the input of all members
and made the final decision on the item's estimate.

## Sprint Backlog #1

For the first sprint, the top eight prioritized items were selected from the product backlog:

> 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 20, 9, and 12

Each of these items were additionally groomed to adhere to DEEP principles. The table below summarizes
the individual tasks that the team believes needs to be completed in order to meet the first sprint
objective. Each team member agreed to work over a four-week period and contribute 10 to 12 hours per
week.

`\* TODO: Each member come up with a number of tasks that equal 40 to 48 effort hours? *\`
