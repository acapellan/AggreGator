## From Essential Scrum

- Sprint reviews inspect the product itself
- Spring retrospectives examines the process used to build the product

## Identify Insights

The participants next identify insights by collaboratively examining, interpreting, and understanding
both the objective and subjective data. Doing this effectively requires a system-level focus, which
helps teams find the root cause of issues. Brainstorming is an excellent activity for capturing
insights. Another source might be the team's insight backlog, a list of previously generated insights
that have not yet been acted upon. The insight backlog is typically updated at the end of each sprint
to reflect new insights.

- how did we work as a team?
- health of team relationships
- collaboration
- processes and tools functionality

### What worked well this sprint that we want to continue doing?

- daily scrum works, we all check in and share what's going on
- weekly video meetings work, we have all attended and accomplished our goals during this time
- communication is good
- we are all respectful to each other, good chemistry is developing

### What did not work well this sprint that we should stop doing?

- first impression, this sprint was not very technical, maybe not enough "stress on the system" to
answer this
- one member drowning out the others with their ideas, not allowing others to contribute?
- overwhelmed by the size and scope of the project?
- 

### Where are some opportunities to do things differently?

### What should we start doing or improve?

## Select/Group Insights

## Vote on Insights

- dot votes?

## Decide on Actions

Once the team has identified their insights, they need to move from discussing them to taking
demonstrable actions to leverage them. Often, the team identifies more insights than it can address
during any one sprint. When this happens, the team will need to prioritize the insights, perhaps
through dot voting or some other prioritization activity. The team members will also need to determine
how much capacity they will have for any improvement actions during the upcoming sprint.

Once the team has prioritized its insights and estimated its capacity, the team can define concrete,
actionable steps to leverage the insights and improve the Scrum process. Most actions will take the
form of specific tasks that one or more Scrum team members will perform during the upcoming sprint.
Sometimes the actions represent impediments that the ScrumMaster might own but someone outside the
Scrum team must resolve. Sometimes, teams discover that it isn't possible to immediately address the
insight and have to choose instead to explore the insight. All of these actions can be tracked in the
insight backlog.

## Grading Rubric

- used inputs & activities to establish common ground
- worked well reflection
- didn't work well reflection
- plan for improvement
