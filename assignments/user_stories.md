#### Conversation

- What criteria could be used to find the user a suitable study partner? 
- What types of criteria should the partner have to encourage the user to study? 
- Should each class have its own set of criteria or is there a way to generalize the data? 
  
#### Confirmation

- Each user can have a general set of criteria that they’re looking for in a study partner. This can be saved in their user profile. Users can navigate to the user profile and update a menu with a few categories.  
- User can input the amount of time they wish to spend studying per week and select their available days of the week. Drop down menu can include days of the week to add and available time slots. Then the menu would add up the total time to spend studying. The system would also have a way to ensure the user does not schedule studying time during a class or a blocked-out time slot (user preferences).
